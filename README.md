# BattleShip Console Application

First app using the C#/.NET Framework that creates a playful console application.

## Personal Note

As my first C#/.Net app Visual Code 2019, I started with absolutely no knowledge of neither access modifiers nor new data types. I used online resources to self-educate, then I built a pseudo-code foundation using pencil and paper. My pseudo-code lead me to investigate instances of a class and to consider the question "Class of what?" Originally, I answered this question with "Class of "Coordinate" with sub-class Ship and sub-class Water," but this became more complicated than necessary when a simple boolean attribute would suffice. From there, the project took on a life of its own and practically finished itself!

I came to this project with huge sense of tension, worry, and apprehension and I'm leaving satisfied!
